Redux is a popular library for managing state in frontend applications. As a front-end or full-stack developer, it is important to be skilled in using Redux. Thanks for everything, Redux!

This course contains everything you need to get started with Redux and Redux Toolkit. It includes all the necessary tools and packages to get you up and running quickly. With this course, you'll be able to learn Redux and Redux Toolkit in no time.

The first few lectures of this course are an introduction to Redux and Redux Toolkit.

The next part of the course is dedicated to the Redux core.

We explain how to use the Redux state and action structures.

Finally, we talk about how to build the Redux application.

After that, we jump into the react-redux library.

Welcome to Redux

Redux is a powerful tool that can help you manage the state of your applications. We'll explain what redux is and how you can use it to improve your applications. We'll also show you how to implement reducers, actions and redux-thunk.

# Some of the topics we will cover

In the next section, we will discuss how to use Redux with react

Firstly we explained these terms
